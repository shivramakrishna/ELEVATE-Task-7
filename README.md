# ELEVATE-Task-7
In this task, we used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to perform binary classification on the Breast Cancer dataset. We began by preprocessing the dataâ€”dropping the `id` column, encoding the `diagnosis` labels (M=1, B=0), and standardizing the features. We then trained two SVM models: one with a linear kernel and another with a non-linear RBF kernel. Both models were evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. To improve performance, we applied hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best `C` and `gamma` values for the RBF SVM. Finally, we validated both models using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure their stability and reliability.
